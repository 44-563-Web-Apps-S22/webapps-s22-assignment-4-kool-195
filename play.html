                ACT I<br>
            SCENE I<br>
                Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante
            </h3>
            
                <b>Mme. Pernelle.</b><br>
                Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.<br>
                <b>Elmire.</b><br>
                  I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.<br>
                <b>Mme. Pernelle.</b><br>
                  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
                I don't wish to cause you any bother.<br>
        <b>Elmire.</b><br>
          What duty demands, I insist on giving.
        But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?<br>
        
        <b>Dorine.</b><br>
         If . . .<br>
        <b>Mme. Pernelle.</b><br>
        You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
        A little brazen and very sassy,
        You butt into everything to speak your mind.<br>
        <b>Damis.</b> <br>
         But . . .<br>
            <b>Mariane.</b> <br>
             I think . . .<br>
      <b>Elmire.</b><br>
       But . . .<br>
    <b>Cleante.</b><br>
     Madam, after all . . .<br>
        Your man Tartuffe is satisfied, no fear . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b><br>
  He is a holy man whom all should hear,
        And I cannot bear, without great rue,
        To hear him mocked by a fool like you.<br>
<b>Damis.</b><br>
 What?  Am I myself to bear a carping critic,
        A base usurper with a power tyrannic,
        Such that we can do nothing for diversion
        Without hearing about that creep's aversion?<br>

    <b>SCENE II</b><br>
Cleante, Dorine<br>
</h3>
<b>Cleante.</b><br>                        I'm not following;
        I'm sure there'd only be more quarrelling.
        How that old harridan . . .<br>
<b>Dorine. </b><br>                         Oh, how I regret
        That she can't hear you use that epithet.
        She'd tell you at length what she thinks of your wit,
        And that she's not old enough to merit it.<br>
        <b>Cleante.</b><br>  What a fuss she made about nearly nothing!
        And what a passion for Tartuffe, her darling!<br>
        <b>Dorine.</b><br>  Oh!  Really, she's normal compared to her son,
        And if you could see him, you'd say, "Here's one
        Who's nuts!"  During the war, he seemed quite sage,
        And in serving his prince, showed some courage,
        But now he's become an absolute fool
        Since he gave himself up to Tartuffe's rule.
        He calls him his brother and the love of his life--
        More dear than mother, daughter, son, or wife.
        He's the sole confidant of all his secrets
        And the sole director of all his projects.
        He caresses him, kisses him, and could not show a mistress
        More love and affection than he gives to this
        Leech.  At dinner he gives him the highest place
        And watches with joy as he stuffs his face
        With cakes and tarts and often the best part
        Of a pig, and if he should happen to hiccup or fart,
        Says, "God be with you!"  He's mad about him--
        His honey, his hero.  He always quotes him
        And admires his deeds.  His smallest acts are miracles
        And even his stupidest words are oracles.
        Tartuffe, who uses his dupe to make a buck,
        Knows a hundred wily ways to pluck this duck;
        He rakes off great sums with his biblical bull
        And demands the right to censor us all.
        His foolish footman has such presumption
        That even he dares to give us instruction.
        Madly preaching, he scatters with eyes afire
        Our ribbons, our rouge, and our best attire.
        Last night he ripped up with his own bare hands
        A kerchief left lying in The Holy Lands,
        Claiming our crime was truly gigantic
        In mixing what's holy with what's Satanic.<br>
