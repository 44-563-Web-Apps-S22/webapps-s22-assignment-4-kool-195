        Cleante.  Madam, after all . . .
        <h6 class="name">Mme.</h6><p class="speech Mme">Pernelle.And her brother, as for you,<br>
                I respect you, love you, and revere you, too,<br>
                But finally, if I were my son, her spouse,<br>
                I would at once beg you to leave this house.<br>
                Without cease you teach your rules and mottos<br>
                Which decent people should never follow.<br>
                I now speak frankly, but it is my part;<br>
                I never spare the words that stir my heart.</p>
        <h6 class="name">Damis.</h6> <p class="speech Damis">Your man Tartuffe is satisfied, no fear . . .</p>
        <h6 class="name">Mme.</h6> <p class="speech Mme">Pernelle.  He is a holy man whom all should hear,<br>
                And I cannot bear, without great rue,<br>
                To hear him mocked by a fool like you.</p>
        <h6 class="name">Damis.</h6> <p class="speech Damis"> What?  Am I myself to bear a carping critic,
                A base usurper with a power tyrannic,<br>
                Such that we can do nothing for diversion<br>
                Without hearing about that creep's aversion?</p>
        <h6 class="name">Dorine.</h6> <p class="speech Dorine"> If we were to hear and obey his whims,<br>
                We couldn't do anything without sins</br>
                For he forbids all, this false Capuchin.</p>
        <h6 class="name">Mme.</h6> <p class="speech Mme">Pernelle.  And everything he forbids is well forbidden.<br>
                He strives to guide you on the road to heaven,<br>
                And it's my son's duty to make you love him.</p>
